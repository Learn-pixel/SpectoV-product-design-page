## My experience
When I began working on the DefXV product page, the official SpectoV site wouldn’t load, and their social media offered little clarity.Coming in late—due to missing the email—I realized if I, as a developer, was confused, a first-time user would be too. This highlighted a core issue—a lack of clarity and user trust due to an underdeveloped online presence. That moment shaped my approach: instead of tweaking the existing page, I decided to redesign it from scratch.

While the original website had engaging features like the rotatable product view and animated elements, I found the layout overwhelming, the visual hierarchy unclear, and the excessive motion distracting. Specs were presented in a minimal format, CTAs were scattered, and there was little emotional connection or structured flow—elements that are vital in encouraging users to stay, explore, and convert. 

In the next 6–7 hours, I focused on creating a user-first design that told a story. I added structured sections, trust signals like testimonials, subtle animations for flow, and a countdown timer to build urgency. My goal was to guide the user step-by-step with clarity and confidence. Throughout, I made every decision with the user’s mindset in focus—what would they feel, what would they need, and what would make them stay?

This experience taught me to take initiative, empathize with users, and own my mistakes. Even if I’m not shortlisted, I’m grateful to SpectoV for turning a missed opportunity into one of my most valuable learning moments as a budding UI/UX designer.
