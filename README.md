## My experience
When I began working on the DefXV product page, I encountered several challenges. The official SpectoV link wasn’t opening, and their social media offered little useful information about the product. As someone coming into the project later than others-because of a blunder(on my side) of not checking mails-this lack of clarity mirrored the confusion a potential customer might face—uncertainty, hesitation, and lack of trust due to poor online presence. I realized if I, as a developer, struggled to understand the product, users would too. So, I took the initiative to design a complete, compelling product page from scratch. I focused on clearly presenting features, building trust through testimonials, adding urgency with a countdown, and maintaining smooth visual flow with subtle animations. Though I started late, I adapted quickly, made design decisions with the user’s mindset in focus, and overcame technical setbacks to ensure the final product delivers a clear, engaging experience. This experience taught me the importance of taking initiative, thinking like the end user, and owning up to my mistakes.
