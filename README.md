## My experience
When I began working on the DefXV product page, the official SpectoV site wouldn’t load, and their social media offered little clarity.Coming in late—due to missing the email—I realized if I, as a developer, was confused, a first-time user would be too. This highlighted a core issue—a lack of clarity and user trust due to an underdeveloped online presence. That moment shaped my approach: instead of tweaking the existing page, I decided to redesign it from scratch.

While the original website had engaging features like the rotatable product view and animated elements, I found the layout overwhelming, the visual hierarchy unclear, and the excessive motion distracting. Specs were presented in a minimal format, CTAs were scattered, and there was little emotional connection or structured flow—elements that are vital in encouraging users to stay, explore, and convert. 

In the next 6–7 hours, I focused on creating a user-first design that told a story. I added structured sections, trust signals like testimonials, subtle animations for flow, and a countdown timer to build urgency. My goal was to guide the user step-by-step with clarity and confidence. Throughout, I made every decision with the user’s mindset in focus—what would they feel, what would they need, and what would make them stay?

Though I understand that I may not be shortlisted, I see this challenge as an invaluable opportunity. I took responsibility for my delay, refused to give up, and turned a missed opportunity into a meaningful learning experience. I'm genuinely thankful to SpectoV for this chance to grow—not just as a UI/UX designer, but as someone learning to take initiative, empathize with users, and deliver under pressure.
